## CS426 Agent-Based Modelling And Simulation (ABMS)

This repository contains my solutions for a course in agent-based modelling and simulation. This course introduces agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) as an approach for studying complex business and social processes. With examples from domains such as transportation, economics, finance, and urban planning, it shows how ABMS can help in better understanding complex business and social phenomena. ABMS systems are particularly powerful if we want to describe a system populated by many independent and heterogeneous decision makers (who can be collaborators or competitors). ABMS systems can also be used in performing policy evaluations and generating decision supports, as we can then computationally test how changes in parameters at different levels would affect various performance indicators.

Besides covering theoretic foundations of ABMS, the course focuses heavily on hands-on learning as well. In particular, the course will expose students to **NetLogo**, an intuitive yet powerful modeling language for building ABMS systems.

#### Course Outline:

* Analyze real-world computational competition models.
* Know tools availability for opponent modeling and analysis.
* Explain the importance of opponent modeling in constructing ABMS.
* Identify real-world scenarios that can benefit from using ABMS.
* Identify the benefits and cost associated with the construction of ABMS.
* Rigorously construct the framework for ABMS.
* Understand feasible and reasonable mechanisms for individual actors to communicate with each other.
* Decompose a complex business scenario into many actors representing physical entities in the scenario.
* Implement ABMS for a number of real-world domains (e.g., finance, marketing, and operations management) using selected frameworks and tools (mostly NetLogo).
* In a well-defined environment, design and construct major components that are associated to real-world roles (for example, various types of traders in financial markets and participants in a supply chain management scenario).
* Know how to systematically explore the parameter space of an ABMS and conduct post-simulation analysis.
* Effectively communicate and resolve conflicts while working in a self-chosen team with peers of various abilities and attitudes.
